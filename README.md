👋 Hi, I'm Leeroy!

👀 I have a keen interest in exploring and interpreting data to uncover valuable insights and patterns.

🌱 I'm currently enhancing my skills in data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques to better understand and communicate data-driven stories.

💞️ I'm open to collaborating on projects that involve analyzing data to gain meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making. Let's work together to make data come alive!

📫 You can reach me on GitHub or via email - leeroymanyere4@gmail.com. I'm excited to connect and explore the fascinating world of data analysis!
